# Java IRC Bot with RSS feed reader

The purpose of this software is to fetch information from different sources (RSS and Atom) 
and publish them on an IRC channel on a specific IRC server. Think of it as a RSS 
client reader but with IRC support.

This project is not under active development but its source code will be used to demo the
use of the [Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA)](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/static-code-analysis-sast/overview) and [Fortify Software Security Center (SSC)](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/software-security-assurance-sdlc/overview) tools in a [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) pipeline.
